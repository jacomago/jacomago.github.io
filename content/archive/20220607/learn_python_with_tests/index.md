For teaching some of my friends some basic programming with python, I started out with [Invent with Python](inventwithpython.com/). However, I found it didn't teach some software development skills such as testing.

So I changed the curriculum and focused on having tests to showcase how to do [simple things](https://github.com/jacomago/learn_python_with_tests/tree/master/tests/examples) and to test [tictactoe](https://github.com/jacomago/learn_python_with_tests/tree/master/tests/tic_tac_toe).

I'm now trying to add some simple packaging and types via mypy as an example of what I think are best practices.

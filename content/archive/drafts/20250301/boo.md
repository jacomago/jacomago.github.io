Sandwiched between tow bolsters, myegs begin to scream they shout why, why have you put us in this position. Becuase i need  you to stretch I shout back. 

My taekwondo competition is in only a month, and I know, that eany inclination that I don't have the splits will be an immediate minus ten. Sandy keeps saying it doesn't matter that much, I already have a kick high enough to wipe out the tallest dude inthe class, but I know the judeges don't care. They expect perfection, and the least amount of effort for a striking blow. 

Tilda left me a note on my desk at school, and I put that message into these legs. "You're ugly, you're fat, no one likes you and you'll forever be alone" I knwo why she sent that message, but it helps, helps me fight the pain the legs and keep pushing.

Sandy brings me her milk for lunch every day, she's lactose intolerant and can't drink it. She can ask for a differnt one, but she never does, instead she brings it to me, and we sit and share stoies of chaffing under the judo suits, sports bras that fit for just one day. And Tilda, well, she...

"Princeeeeeesss, i'm home." 

Dad.

"I brought pizza."

"I can't eat pizza Dad!" I shout downstairs. 

"Yes, you can honey, it's your favourite, chicken and pineapple." 

"No Dad, I can't. I have to lose five kilos before the comp!"

He barges through the door and looks down at me on the floor. Legs stradling it, watching the latest episode of teen titans on my phone.

"Well, that doesnt look comfortable." He plops down the pixxa next to me, opens the box and goddam takes a slice right in front of me. "Has nightwing gotten over starfire yet?"

"No Dad!"

"He hasn't? It's been like ten episodes."

"No, I mean don't sit here with the pizza near my face." I reach over and grab a slice. Oh its so good. "Wait, you forgot the red onion."

My Dad looks down at me, half a slice iun his mouth. "I don't like red onion..."

"Get out!" I scream.

And he runs out the room laughing. Goddamn Dad. But he did leave the pizza, maybe just one more slice.

"It's called a french kiss. I've done it once." 

"With who?" I ask drinking Sandy's milk.

Sandy looks at me side faced. "A friend."

I can see Tilda giving me devils eyes across the room.

"Joey?"

"Nope"

"Sam?"

"Nope"

"Not Anthony"

"Eww, gross. No."

I suddenly realise how sad tilda looks.

"Tilda" I whisper.

Sandy looks at me harshly.

"Tilda's not my friend... anymore."

In clas I show Joey how my splits are progressing and he gives me all the ooohs and wows and that's amazing that I want and totally deserve. Coach however tells me that my front split is pretty good, but if I want full makrs I 'll hav eot get lower ot the floor.

Bitch, a little encouragement wouldn't hurt, but I take it in my soul, I'll use it tonight.

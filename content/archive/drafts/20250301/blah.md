Sandpaper tastes better in the morning. At night ready to go to sleep, you don't want that bitter residue, that sticky glue tanging up your mouth. In the morning, however, it comes alive and brings you awake.

Ofcourse, sitting here amongst cables and wet drippin walls, and electric wires stuck to your balls. Gives you quite a different perspective on what is a pleasant vs not pleasnt experience. Some of it is the timing, sandpaper in the morning, force feeding int he evening, sexual assault among the noon atime, and always the insults, they seem ever so funny during the wee hours of the morning when you can't understand anything anyway.

Will I finally give myself up to my tortureers and tell them the truth? Oh, but I alreay have, several times. As well as to lies, anything they've said to me I've agredd, no matter what it was. 

Some days the pain gets so nullified, the humiliation so beyond experencing, that I have no care in the world. I could be as happy as a fish, I have no need to even think of anyone in a negative light because everything is null, everyting faces the saem direction after all., death.

I personaly think they gave up a long time ago, they stapped expecting any informaiotn from me, within the first hour. Now it is a ritual, as thoguh i am some sacrifice repeateadly sought to give just a little bit more to a god I will never meet. A god, that relishes in pain.

I have heard, through the walls, and from themsleves, that I and all of my other captured colleagues here have been marked as dead by both their governements and my own. I can only hope for some end of this war, to end my own suffereing, whether through death as this land attempts to wash their hands of what hey have done to me, or through release, and I cna kill myself, so as to not remember a single moment of this time.

But back to the sandpaper, it brings forth blood on the tongue, it brings forth a swlling and pain, and blood is a sustenance. When they force feed you, you have no choice, here I can let it well and enjoy it.

French Fries

Hey, I'll give you a lift, but you have to rpmise me one thing.

What is it? I mean I'd do pretty much any thing fo you anyway.

Just, don't mention the spiders.

Kelly gets int eh car, and I take the passenger side, I don't see any spiders. I look around trying to check.

"oh, haha, very funny." 

As he backs up, he ain't smiling. 

It's late, round two in the morning, the street lights thump across the windsheild and as we spin across the motorway. I think I'm about to pass out. 

"Want some music?"

"Sure i say." 

He takes out a cassette.

"What the fuck is this, the nineteen..."

He hushes me with his finger as the beat starts jumping on, a rolling heavy set of drums and a low rumble of the bass warming up.

"What is this?"

Again he motions for to be queit as he nods his head. The flow matches the lights and I can feel my body pulsating with it. My mind softening but sharpening to the moment at th esame time. 

"Holy fucking shit" I scream. 

A giant fucking spider, size of my apartment block is walking acorss the motorway over the top of us.

"What the.."

"shut the fuck up." says Kelly as he keeps driving and swerves around a leg.

The lights don't match the beat no more, broken by the shadows cast byt the omnstrosity above us. I look up at it through the windsheild. A screaming guitar solo sets off cutting through the drums and the bass as though from another song entirely.

I look at Kelly, focused on tehroad, wondering what th fuck when I see anohter one, and another one and another one. 

"Shit" I see him say. "Kids"

A stream of car sized spiders running over th top of each other stream over the road. Kelly swerves to get ahead of them, but I don't know how he can, their so fast and so...

they Sprawl over the car, it doesn't seme to slow down but I feel and hear there thmping acorss the bonnet and roof. Keely is just grimacing.

We spin into the slow lane. Noanother car on the road, but the beat goes on. Words fall through the speakers.

"Salamader good times, Salamander good times. Got ge thtem salamnder good times. All we all go craaaazy."

"Who is this ?" 

But Kelly is somewhere else, tapping the car wheel, toatlly in the zone enjoying the beat, singing along ot the lyrics.

"Salamander good times, Salamander good times."

I see just one spider left on the road now, a lot smaller than the others, maybe just the size of a motorbike. It wobbles and scurries slowly across the road. Wait, is it?

"Yo Larry, My man. Keep it up my good boy!" 

Kelly's out the window, scraming at the this fucking spider, what the hell.

the psiders boucing to the beat and starts waving some limbs at us. Keely drives aroudn Larry sreaming

"Woo hoo. You got some balls on you Larry. I saw your kids, man, fantastic."

Suddenly I see Lary as some old man, whithered but still got some spunk in him. Boucing to the music and Kelly is, what here exactly.

We drive on, past the motorway, and see other cars once again. Keely steers us into a drive through, orders some french fires.

"So what the hell... " I begin.

Kelly just looks at me passing over a french fry. 

"You primised."

and I jsut take it.

I found another couple of interesting images from my masters.

![Circles Orthogonal to to a single circle](circle_orthog.png)
![Hyperbolas Orthogonal to a single hyperbola](hyper_orthog.png)

They represent cycles orthogonal to a single cycle. A cycle is a representation of all numbers equidistant from a complex or double number (numbers of the form x + yj, where j squared is one).

Here are double cycles orthogonal to the x axis.

- Increased the features of the Airedale BMS platform by developing new graphics, using a component based embedded Java built on top of Niagara from Tridium. Designed custom 3D bar charts, rainbow dials and others. Filled the charts using SQL queries on temperature and other data pulled from onsite sensors.
- Developed a psychrometric chart for finding different refrigeration metrics, which the engineering department then used instead of old paper copies.
- Led a team of two new hires to work on existing and new projects, in Tridium and Niagara systems.
  - **_Technologies used:_** Tridium, Java, Linux

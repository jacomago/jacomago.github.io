Technical owner of the modelling core codebase which involves managing code audits, new requests and maintenance. Brought about an increase in testing and code quality measurement to push up code coverage by over 30%. Introduced higher product quality with development of new features, including different compensation algorithms, tree view of portfolio strategy and multiple performance optimisations. Coordination with the customer led to a new co-developed feature, a new way of loading time series in memory in a legacy Oracle based product that increased system performance by over 90%. Mentoring a new start in the team following our extensive number of development patterns, running knowledge transfers to increase cross area collaboration. Designed and developed a product during a hackathon for deciding what to do with excess cash, using Spring Boot, Banking Open APIs and gradle in team. Enjoyed collaborating with front developers and Business Analysts to bring a product to life within 12 hours. Took part in Chess tournaments, set up ping pong tournaments and presented multiple talks on Mathematics and Science to the centre. Technologies used: pl/SQL, SQL.   Mathematics PhD Student @ University of York (Sept 2013 - Sept 2017)\n Calculated 2 million values of the continued fraction expansion of algebraic numbers, implemented in Java and run on the university’s HPC, creating a total of 8.2 GB of data to be analysed using a python based Jupyter notebook.

Designed and implemented the BMS for a new data centre at the University of Portsmouth using Niagara, Java and Inkscape/GIMP. Increased the features of the Airedale BMS platform by developing new graphics, using a component based embedded Java built on top of Niagara from Tridium. Designed custom 3D bar charts, rainbow dials and others. Filled the charts using SQL queries on temperature and other data pulled from onsite sensors. Developed a psychrometric chart for finding different refrigeration metrics, which the engineering department then used instead of old paper copies. Led a team of two new hires to work on existing and new projects, in Tridium and Niagara systems.

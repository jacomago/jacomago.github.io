Enums Enums are a way of having multiple options programmatically, when a Boolean (true or false) isn&amp;rsquo;t expressive enough. Think traffic lights: Red, Orange, Green, Http Status Codes: Unauthorized, Not Found, OK,&amp;hellip;, and Countries: Germany, Poland, Great Britain, England? UK?&amp;hellip;
Some things seem obviously able to fit into an Enum data type, until they don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

Flutter Last year I took a in Angular from Udemy, but for this project as Angular appears to be slowly dying, I decided to use another possible Google dead-horse, Flutter.
This time I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a book, or tutorial or such to start building the application. For one, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a good up to date tutorial and I somehow expected a quite prescriptive development environment, which was not what happened.</description>

Rust I like to follow trends as much as the next guy, so I&amp;rsquo;m writing the backend in rust.
There were two main resources that I used:
&amp;lsquo;Zero To Production In Rust&amp;rsquo; (zero2prod), a great book about building a backend service from scratch using actix. It&amp;rsquo;s what I based most of my server code on.</description>

      <description>For the last month or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Story Stains, an app to help analyze stories and find out how they tick.
The past year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been attempting to write my own stories and in this journey I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt the necessity to understand how they work. First, from a course on writing I took from Faber, and secondly from multiple &amp;lsquo;how to write books&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve written freeform reviews, structured reviews with template headings of &amp;lsquo;Characters&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Setting&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Theme&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Mood&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Pace&amp;rsquo;, and attempted to make a questionnaire: &amp;lsquo;What are the main themes?</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve got to sit in the chair.
For the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying write a good book. At first, I tried without external help. No teacher, no course, no writing group. Me and the blank piece of paper. I found it gruelling. I got better. I wrote four or five short stories and the first twenty thousand words plus of two books, which sounds like a lot to me now.</description>

      <description>I found another couple of interesting images from my masters.
They represent cycles orthogonal to a single cycle. A cycle is a representation of all numbers equidistant from a complex or double number (numbers of the form x + yj, where j squared is one).
Here are double cycles orthogonal to the x axis.</description>

      <title>Beginning Generative Art</title>

      <description>Recently I started making generative art with nannou.
It made me think about when I first got interested. I can remember as a child in Primary school - 5- 11 year old - being tasked to make diagrams like this:
I can also remember in Year three - age eight - in art class and being given the project of filling an A4 page of square boxes with different patterns and being one of the few in the class to have finished the project.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve got to sit in the chair.
For the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying write a good book. At first, I tried without external help. No teacher, no course, no writing group. Me and the blank piece of paper. I found it gruelling. I got better. I wrote four or five short stories and the first twenty thousand words plus of two books, which sounds like a lot to me now.</description>

      <description>I found another couple of interesting images from my masters.
They represent cycles orthogonal to a single cycle. A cycle is a representation of all numbers equidistant from a complex or double number (numbers of the form x + yj, where j squared is one).
Here are double cycles orthogonal to the x axis.</description>

      <title>Beginning Generative Art</title>

      <description>Recently I started making generative art with nannou.
It made me think about when I first got interested. I can remember as a child in Primary school - 5- 11 year old - being tasked to make diagrams like this:
I can also remember in Year three - age eight - in art class and being given the project of filling an A4 page of square boxes with different patterns and being one of the few in the class to have finished the project.</description>
